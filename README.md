# Min-Max-Algorithm
This C program is designed to find the maximum and minimum elements in an array of integers using a divide-and-conquer approach, specifically the "maxmin" function.

### How to Use:
1. Compile the program using a C compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable.
3. Enter the total number of numbers in the array as prompted.
4. Enter the numbers one by one.
5. The program will output the maximum and minimum elements found in the array.

### Files Included:
- `min_max.c`: Contains the C source code.
- `README.md`: This file providing information about the program.

### Usage Notes:
- The program assumes that the user will input valid integers.
- It handles arrays of various sizes efficiently using recursion.
- Users can modify the program to suit specific needs, such as adding error handling or integrating it into larger projects.

### Contributions:
Contributions to improve the program's efficiency, readability, or functionality are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or report any issues encountered.
